            <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. C# has its roots in the C family of languages
                and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples,
                try the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/">introduction to C#</a> tutorials.</p>
            <p>C# is an object-oriented, <span class="text-marked">component-oriented</span> programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components.
                Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices.</p>
            <p>Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/"><span class="text-marked">Garbage collection</span></a> automatically reclaims memory occupied
                by unreachable unused objects. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references"><span class="text-marked">Nullable types</span></a> guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/exceptions"><span class="text-marked">Exception handling</span></a> provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery.
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions"><span class="text-marked">Lambda expressions</span></a> support functional programming techniques.
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/"><span class="text-marked">Language Integrated Query (LINQ)</span></a> syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/"><span class="text-marked">asynchronous operations</span></a> provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types"><span class="text-marked">unified type system</span></a>. All C# types, including primitive types such as <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>, inherit from
                a single root <code>object</code> type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types">reference types</a>                and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-types">value types</a>. C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods
                and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.</p>
            <p>C# emphasizes <span class="text-marked">versioning</span> to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate
                <code>virtual</code> and <code>override</code> modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.</p>

            <p>C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The
                CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.</p>
            <p>Source code written in C# is compiled into an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code">intermediate language (IL)</a> that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings,
                are stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about the assembly's types, version, and culture.</p>
            <p>When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The CLR performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code to native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services related to automatic garbage collection,
                exception handling, and resource management. Code that's executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as "managed code," in contrast to "unmanaged code," which is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform.</p>
            <p>Language interoperability is a key feature of .NET. IL code produced by the C# compiler conforms to the Common Type Specification (CTS). IL code generated from C# can interact with code that was generated from the .NET versions of F#, Visual
                Basic, C++, or any of more than 20 other CTS-compliant languages. A single assembly may contain multiple modules written in different .NET languages, and the types can reference each other as if they were written in the same language.</p>
            <p>In addition to the run time services, .NET also includes extensive libraries. These libraries support many different workloads. They're organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of useful functionality for everything from file
                input and output to string manipulation to XML parsing, to web application frameworks to Windows Forms controls. The typical C# application uses the .NET class library extensively to handle common "plumbing" chores.</p>

            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:</p>
            <pre><code>
                using System;
                class Hello
                {
                    static void Main()
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
                    }
                }
            </code></pre>
            <p>The "Hello, World" program starts with a <code>using</code> directive that references the <code>System</code> namespace. Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries. Namespaces contain types and other namespacesâ€”for
                example, the <code>System</code> namespace contains a number of types, such as the <code>Console</code> class referenced in the program, and a number of other namespaces, such as <code>IO</code> and <code>Collections</code>. A <code>using</code>                directive that references a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace. Because of the <code>using</code> directive, the program can use <code>Console.WriteLine</code> as shorthand for <code>System.Console.WriteLine</code>.</p>
            <p>The <code>Hello</code> class declared by the "Hello, World" program has a single member, the method named <code>Main</code>. The <code>Main</code> method is declared with the <code>static</code> modifier. While instance methods can reference
                a particular enclosing object instance using the keyword <code>this</code>, static methods operate without reference to a particular object. By convention, a static method named <code>Main</code> serves as the entry point of a C# program.</p>
            <p>The output of the program is produced by the <code>WriteLine</code> method of the <code>Console</code> class in the <code>System</code> namespace. This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically
                referenced by the compiler.</p>
